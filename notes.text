The patterns that I saw while running the tests for the different sized arrays was that the for the extraLargeArray, largeArray and mediumArray the .unshift (insert) functions would take more time as we ran the tests. Although as we got to the smallArray, and tinyArray, we saw the .push (append) functions take longer. This is because when we add a number to the beggining of an array, we have to move each existing number down an index so for the extraLargeArray, that would be 100,000 steps until we could add the new number to index 0. 
As far as scale goes, the .push will always scale better because it isn't having to run through the whole entire array of numbers to put the new number at the begginning, it will put the number at the end instead.
